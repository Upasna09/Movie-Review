    <h3>Did you know?</h3>
    <h4>Trivia</h4>
    <p>The film is partially autobiographical. When Hayao Miyazaki and his brothers were children, his mother suffered from spinal tuberculosis for nine years, and spent much of her time hospitalized. It is implied, yet never revealed in the film, that Satsuki and Mei's mother also suffers from tuberculosis. 
        He once said the film would have been too painful for him to make if the two protagonists were boys instead of girls.

    <h4>Quotes</h4>
    <p>Tatsuo Kusakabe: Trees and people used to be good friends. I saw that tree and decided to buy the house. 
        Hope Mom likes it too. Okay, let's pay our respects then get home for lunch.

    <h4>Alternate version</h4>
    <p>The humorous line spoken at the start of the film, "Come out! Come out! Or we'll pull your eyeballs out!" was deemed 'politically incorrect' by Fox during the making of the English dub. 
        The line is changed to "Come out! Come out!" in the Fox-Streamline English dub.
